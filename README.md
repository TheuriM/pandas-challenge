# pandas-challenge

Introduction
The Pandas Challenge involved analysing schools in a city for:
-Performance in maths and reading
-the effect of amount of per capita funding on performamnce
-the effect of school size on performance
-comaprative study on type of school vis a vis performance

The assignment had a starter code which I used to build on for the rest of the code. I also sought ASKBCS for assistance on some errors; ASKBCS guided to add , "observed = False" to the code at In(106) and In(110).

Summary of Observations
1. General
    - Performance in reading was higher than in math in all the schools analysed.

2. Scores by School Size
    - Schools with more students had lower scores than those with fewer in general. There are a few exepetions to this trend and ultimately middle-sized schools outperformed both small and large schools.

3. Scores by School Type
    - Charter schools have a way better performance compared to district schools. All the top 5 schools are charter schools while the bottom five are all district schools.

4. Scores by school spending
    - Schools with lower spending per student have better performance than those with higher spends. This is explainable by the fact that those with higher per capita    spend are also the schools with the largest number of students.
